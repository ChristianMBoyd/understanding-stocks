\section{Banks create money}

Mostly, I want to put the ideas and findings of \cite{Werner2014} into context.  I think  Werner is intentionally provocative due to decades of frustration arguing against academic arguments that lack real-world (i.e., empirical) backing.  As a result, I find a lot of Werner's arguments tautological and somewhat repetitive in nature, as I believe this paper needed to an airtight demonstration that the academic mechanisms of banking simply didn't reflect reality.  Nevertheless, I also believe that the paper demonstrates how a bank actually works and want to flesh out the nature of money creation carried out by {\it individual} banks.
