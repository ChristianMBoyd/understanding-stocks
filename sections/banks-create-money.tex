\section{Banks create money}

Mostly, I want to put the ideas and findings of Richard Werner's {\it Can banks individually create money out of nothing?} \cite{Werner2014} into my own words.  I think  Werner is intentionally provocative due to decades of frustration arguing against academic claims that lack real-world (i.e., empirical) backing.  I find a lot of Werner's arguments tautological and somewhat repetitive in nature, though I'm sure he needed to present his claims in an undeniable fashion.  Nevertheless, I also believe that the paper demonstrates how a bank actually works and want to flesh out my personal understanding of how {\it individual} banks create money in practice.


\subsection{The separation of loans from deposits}

One of Werner's main points is that deposits and loans are not restricted by one another in the real banking system.  In the naive explanation of banking,\footnote{Without providing a specific source, I've heard similar explanations in modern media discussions of banking, financy, and money in general.  The goal of this example is to contrast with the ideas proposed by Werner, rather than ``disprove'' a particular banking theory or one of its proponents.} banks generate profit due to the difference in the interest rates of loans they extend and the interest they pay to their depositors.  In this model, loans are extended because there are deposits sitting around in the bank burning a hole in the bank's pocket.  Since loans in this model are backed by deposits, a deposit needs to enter the bank vaults (physically or digitally) before a loan can be extended.  Notably, this concept appears in both the {\it financial intermediary} and {\it fractional reserve} theories of banking proposed by Werner as alternatives to the money creation theory of banking.\footnote{The details of these alternatives are thoroughly reviewed in \cite{Werner2014}.  I don't claim that banks don't operate according to a fractional reserve policy with respect to {\it deposits}, but I want to clarify that this aspect of banking is not directly related to loan--and therefore, money--creation.}  

To demonstrate the apparently-startling detachment of loans from deposits in reality, Werner applies for--and receives--a loan from a private bank in Germany.  At no point were the bank {\it deposits} checked or authorized during the loan approval account creation.  Werner claims to then go and spend this money to verify that the subsequent loan-funded account indeed contained real money that could be used in the economy.  Naturally, if the naive explanation of banking held true, then a bank would either have deposits lying around that covered the new loan or it would need to drum up new deposits commensurate with the loan requested.  In both cases, the bank's deposits would need to be checked before the loan could be extended to Werner.


\subsubsection{How banks fund loans without deposits}

Some of the contrary theories of banking covered by Werner make a point of noting that the money must come from {\it somewhere}.  It's only natural to ask where banks get the funds to cover the loans they make, if not from deposits.  Since publishing \cite{Werner2014}, Werner has often noted \note{[add at least one example]} in interviews since that banks are not in the deposit-lending business, but the {\it securities} business.  By removing the assumed role played by deposits in the lending business, we can more critically analyze the value exchanged when a bank makes a loan.  

Banks create loans when the bank and a borrower come to an agreement based on the borrower's credit worthiness and ability to generate sufficient (future) funds to repay the loan.  For lending to be a profitable business, banks must ensure that the loan terms they offer (maturity, payment schedule, interest, etc.) are sufficient cover their risk (borrowers defaulting) with enough margin built in so that they receive sufficiently more than they lend on average.\footnote{I.e., banks must cover their own expenses associated with loan creation to remain in business.}  When a loan is trusted to be profitable, the loan {\it itself} (i.e., the repayment contract between the borrower and the bank) provides the value necessary to fund it.  This line of reasoning underlies the concept of {\it money creation} by individual, private banks.  

In Werner's demonstration of the mechanics behind bank loans \cite{Werner2014}, he finds that--to a reasonable level of certainty--the bank counts the loan an asset that offsets the newly-created deposit associated with his (now funded) bank account.  By contrast, the deposit is counted as a liability on the bank's balance sheet.\footnote{There are general remarks in \cite{Werner2014} related to the counting of deposits in general as liabilities (loans made {\it to} the bank), but for now I'm only focusing on the deposit directly associated with the loan funds.}  Of course, when the funds associated with the newly-created deposit are withdrawn, that is an obligation that must be paid by the bank to the another institution (likely another bank).
